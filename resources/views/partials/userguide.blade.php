<h1>Welcome to KeyChest</h1>

<p>
    We have designed KeyChest as we need to continuously monitor our servers to avoid any downtimes
due to expired or misconfigured certificates. We implemented it as a system you setup once and it just
works.
</p>

<p>
We dreamt of several main features to make it a helping tool, rather than just yet another management system
we have to think about all the time. The best monitoring system is useless, if you forget to register your
servers with it. So KeyChest will automatically find all new servers the moment you get for them the first
certificates.
</p>


<h1>How to use KeyChest</h1>

<p>
    KeyChest gives you a quick information when you are setting up a new server and it continously monitors
    your certificates and servers. It is not intended for thorough security audits as each would take several
    minutes to complete and you really want to run those only when the basics are right (server is running,
    firewall open, TLS setup, certificate installed, etc.). KeyChest helps to quickly complete and verify the
    initial configuration.
</p>

<p>
    KeyChest consists of two main tools:
    <ul>
    <li>Spot check - a quick check of a particular server with instant results. A typical use-case for spot check
    is setup of a new server, or to check correct setup after configuration changes.</li>
    <li>Dashboard - this tool provides a concise but easy to understand overview of the status of all "watched"
    servers or internet domains.</li>
</ul>
If you want to monitor, you need to import some data into a monitoring system first. There are three options
add new servers into KeyChest and some more options, if you deploy it on-premise.

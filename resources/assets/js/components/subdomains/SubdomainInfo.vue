            A unique property of KeyChest allowing it to automatically add new servers in your domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you enable the Watch Now&trade; feature, KeyChest will automatically add all new servers
            for monitoring. They will appear in the dashboard with test results on port 443 (HTTPS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Detection of servers in active domains happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>immediately after you add a new active domain, unless it is already in the KeyChest database; and</li>
            <li>at regular intervals, as defined in the User Guide (up to 48 hours).</li>
        </ul>
